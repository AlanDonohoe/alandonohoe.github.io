I am a Software Developer, based in the UK and Berlin, currently working in Ruby on Rails and JavaScript.

For the last five years, I have been core part of a small team that have helped to make [CoverageBook.com](https://coveragebook.com/) the success it is. We started [CoverageBook.com](https://coveragebook.com/) from scratch two years ago and now it has 1,000's of customers in over 50 countries.

I am also one half of [Free The Trees](http://freethetrees.co.uk/). A partnership where we focus on creative digital ideas. 

We have launched a series of historical fiction apps/books on the iPad, to inspire and educate children [Historical Heroes](http://www.historicalheroes.co.uk/). We also built the hugely successful [Waiting Wall](http://www.thewaitingwall.com/) digital art project.

As part of the annual [Brighton Digitial Festival](http://brightondigitalfestival.co.uk/event/the-waiting-wall/), we won a coveted British Arts Council grant to pay for the building and marketing of the project. After being featured on the home page of [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/21/confessions-commuter-display-board-brighton-digital-festival-waiting-wall), the project then gathered attention from over 200 publications world-wide and on one day received over 6,000 visitors.

I have previously coded in Java and C++.

I have a MSc in IT with Business & Management (with distinction), from Sussex University, a BSc(Hons) in Biological Sciences from Brighton University and even a City & Guilds in OOP with C++.

I am friendly :) My contact details are below.
